        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread crumb-Parmesan mixture. My
          family can't get enough of it! I would suggest doubling the recipe if you
          have very large eaters because this is addictive! Serve with pasta and
          salad.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch
            glass casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and garlic powder in a
            large resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to mix ingredients
            together. Add shrimp and shake to coat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lay shrimp flat in the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with any bread
            crumb mixture remaining in the bag. Drizzle melted butter over the top.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until starting to crisp, 15 to 20 minutes.
            Switch to broil setting until topping is light brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
